# Felicia - an encryption comprehension and learning tool.

I wrote Felicia while studying for a security certification. I simply figured that encryption is so much easier to understand when you write code that handles cryptographic operations.

The idea behind Felicia is simple: first you write some text and then you encrypt it using a cipher, a key and an initialization vector of your choice.

Felica currently supports the following ciphers:
AES
Blowfish





Felica is most happy when she runs atop Python 2.7 with a little
